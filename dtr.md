Project: Futbol

Group Member Names: Alex Osborne, Liam Cusack, James Fox-Collins, Gus Cunningham

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):

Develop better skills and habits for group work, and to use this project as an opportunity to practice commenting on code and developing a good group work flow
Make sure we all have a solid understanding of all of the code we produce
We will aim to achieve a score of at least 3 in each category
Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):

Alex & James are good at breaking down the logic of what we need to do Gus likes planning & organizing and can help set up git projects & monitor timelines Liam is great at troubleshooting & spotting errors

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:

We will use our problem-solving skills to address code-related obstacles, and we are comfortable communicating our needs and opinions to one another in case disagreements come up within the group.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):

We will aim keep Saturdays open for personal stuff
Things to schedule around:
family dinners
mentor meetings - aim to meet in roughly 1st hour after class, although we can work around meetings as necessary
other schedule conflicts in personal lives as they occur - just make sure to communicate to group in advance
Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):

We plan to have a daily standup meeting
Major decisions should be discussed as a team, and we will aim to reach consensus among at least 3 group members for big decisions regarding the project. If we are unable to reach ao consensus we will seek advice or an additional opinion from an outside source like a mentor or cohort-mate
communicate via group slack channel
We agree to respect boundaries if someone needs to take a break/stop work early on a given day, although that does not mean work for the entire group will stop
Send slack message to teammates when you have submitted a PR that needs to be reviewed
Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):

get better at building and working with nested blocks
develop comfort with github functions targeted at team use (comments, project board)
become more comfortable with testing overall, including mocks and stubs, the Spec Harness, SimpleCov, and Rakefile
learn to work with CSV files
learn to use inheritance and class methods
Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):

we're not familiar enough with the project yet to divide responsibilities, but our goal is to for each one of us to have a complete understanding of each of feature of the project
If something comes up that someone is particularly excited about working on, we plan to bring it up at the standup meeting to discuss how that preference might be be accommodated by the team
We will focus on doing all creative work/creating new code as a group, and reserving our limited solo work to minor tasks
Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):

Try to make sure at least 2 other group members look at and comment on each pull request before it is merged
Make sure we are using the entire team as a resource for problem solving and debugging even when we are doing pair work
Pomodoro Break Schedule

We will use a 25:5 pomodoro schedule, and in the event that we don't want to interrupt a task in progress when we reach 25 minutes we will aim to not go more than 45 minutes without a break
Expectations for giving and receiving feedback

We will re-DTR if necessary; we can bring it up in a standup if we need to
Additional Remote Considerations

note that James is in pacific time zone
Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):

Git Projects
Day 1 Agenda: review project, create a rough plan & complete setup
